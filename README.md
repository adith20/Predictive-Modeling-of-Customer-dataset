# Predictive-Modeling-of-Customer-dataset
This is an Induatry collaborated project, undertaken at ***Purdue University Northwest, United States***.

The model aims to analyze factors that affect the non-paying tendency of customers using Machine Learning models. 
Further, the relationship between non-paying tendencey and risk category of customers were analyzed to predict future trends.

## Dataset

The Customer dataset is of a Utility company in the US. The dataset is restricted due to NDA.

## Result

Predictions have been carried out using Naive Bayes model. Achieved an accuracy of 84.02% & 81.37% for the predictions of Model 1 and Model 2 respectively .
